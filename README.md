# BioIO Devs

This is an organization grouping together `bioio`, a package for image reading, metadata management, and image writing for Microscopy images in pure Python, and some of the plug-ins supported by `bioio` that act as additional readers for microscopy image file types (ex. for OME TIFF images the `bioio-ome-tiff` plug-in/repository/package can be installed and automatically used by `bioio`).

[See the full documentation for bioio for information](https://bioio-devs.github.io/bioio/OVERVIEW.html)
